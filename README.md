# Fast Electron

I was tired of going to the website every time I wanted to check my internet speed, so I created this simple Electron app that wraps the Fast.com speed test service.

## Description

Fast Electron is a desktop application that provides a native experience for the Fast.com speed test service. Built with Electron and TypeScript, it offers a seamless way to check your internet speed from your desktop.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/asmit404/fast_electron.git
cd fast_electron
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Development

- `npm run build` - Build the TypeScript code
- `npm run watch` - Watch for TypeScript changes
- `npm start` - Start the application
- `npm run dist` - Create distributable packages

## Building

To create distributable packages for your platform:

```bash
npm run dist
```

The built applications will be available in the `dist` folder.
